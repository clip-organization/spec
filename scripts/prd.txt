# Overview
CLIP (Context Link Interface Protocol) is a universal, open JSON standard for exposing structured, machine- and LLM-friendly "context" about venues, devices, or services. This repository will serve as the canonical source for the CLIP standard, enabling any agent or AI to access real-time or static information about the physical or digital world.

The spec repository aims to establish CLIP as the go-to standard for machine-readable context, similar to how RSS revolutionized content syndication. It provides schemas, specifications, examples, and validation tools for developers and organizations to create and consume CLIP-compliant data.

# Core Features
## CLIP Schema Definition
- Comprehensive JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) for validation
- Support for multiple object types: Venue, Device, SoftwareApp
- Required fields enforcement: @context, type, id, name, description, lastUpdated
- Optional fields for enhanced functionality: location, features, actions, persona, services, glyphs, signature, locales

## Specification Documentation
- Full Markdown specification detailing object models and field definitions
- Usage guidelines and extensibility guidance
- Agent/LLM interaction flow documentation
- Non-normative notes about future glyph discovery mechanisms

## Example Implementations
- Real-world examples demonstrating CLIP usage
- Gym venue example with equipment tracking and live data
- Smart fridge device example with inventory management
- Museum venue example with exhibit information

## Validation and Testing
- JSON Schema for automated validation
- Test suite with valid and invalid examples
- Clear validation instructions in documentation

# User Experience
## Target Users
- **Agent/AI Developers**: Building intelligent assistants that need context about physical spaces
- **Business Owners**: Wanting to expose their venue/service information to AI systems
- **Device Manufacturers**: Creating smart devices that can communicate their state
- **App Developers**: Building applications that consume or provide contextual information

## Key User Flows
1. **Discovery Flow**: User/agent discovers CLIP URL via QR code or other mechanism
2. **Consumption Flow**: Agent fetches and parses CLIP data to understand context
3. **Interaction Flow**: Agent uses persona guidance and available actions to engage
4. **Validation Flow**: Developer validates their CLIP against the schema

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clear, developer-friendly documentation
- Easy-to-follow examples
- Straightforward validation process
- Accessible contribution guidelines

# Technical Architecture
## Repository Structure
- README.md - Project overview with quickstart guide
- clip-spec.md - Complete specification document
- clip.schema.json - JSON Schema for validation
- examples/ directory with practical implementations
- tests/ directory for validation test cases
- LICENSE file (Apache-2.0)
- .gitignore for standard exclusions

## Data Models
- Base CLIP object with required context fields
- Venue type for physical locations
- Device type for IoT and smart devices
- SoftwareApp type for digital services
- Extensible features array for capabilities/inventory
- Services array for live data endpoints (HTTP, MCP)
- Persona object for agent behavior guidance
- Actions array for available interactions

## Standards and Specifications
- JSON Schema draft 2020-12 compliance
- UTF-8 encoding requirement
- ISO 8601 datetime formats
- Semantic versioning for the spec itself
- URI-based ID system for global uniqueness

# Development Roadmap
## MVP Requirements
- Complete specification document with all field definitions
- Functional JSON Schema that validates all object types
- Three comprehensive examples (gym, fridge, museum)
- Basic README with installation and usage instructions
- Apache-2.0 license file
- Repository initialization with proper .gitignore

## Phase 2: Enhanced Documentation
- Extended examples covering edge cases
- Contribution guidelines
- Schema migration guide for future versions
- Best practices documentation
- FAQ section addressing common questions

## Phase 3: Tooling and Ecosystem
- Validation CLI tool
- Schema test suite
- Example generator/templates
- Documentation website
- Community forum/discussion setup

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation Setup**: Initialize repository structure, license, gitignore
2. **Core Specification**: Define the complete CLIP specification document
3. **Schema Development**: Create JSON Schema based on the specification
4. **Example Creation**: Build practical examples demonstrating key features
5. **Documentation**: Write comprehensive README and usage guides
6. **Validation**: Implement test cases for schema validation
7. **Polish**: Review, refine, and ensure consistency across all artifacts

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges
- **Schema Complexity**: Risk of overly complex schema → Start simple, iterate based on feedback
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Future version conflicts → Clear versioning strategy from v1
- **Adoption Barriers**: Developers finding it hard to implement → Provide clear examples and tools

## Standards Alignment
- **Competing Standards**: Other context protocols emerging → Focus on simplicity and LLM optimization
- **Schema Evolution**: JSON Schema spec changes → Pin to specific draft version

## Community Management
- **Contribution Quality**: Inconsistent PRs → Clear contribution guidelines
- **Feature Creep**: Scope expansion → Maintain focused vision on core use cases
